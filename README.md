# AirQualityIndex
Gathering and Analyzing Data from the World Air Quality Index Project

The first goals are to understand:
* What a Web API is
* Learn how to use the HTTP request GET with JavaScript
* How create and display HTML elements with JavaScript

This [web-page](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/) is hopefully helpful to proceed
